## 🐛 Common Issues to Check

### **Issue 1: Dropdowns Empty**
**Symptom:** When editing assets/goals, owner dropdowns are empty  
**Check:** Make sure family members loaded (console: `appState.familyMembers`)  
**Fix:** Refresh page and reload sample data

### **Issue 2: Charts Not Rendering**
**Symptom:** Blank chart areas  
**Check:** Browser console for errors  
**Likely cause:** Chart.js not loaded, check CDN link in index.html

### **Issue 3: Ownership Not Showing**
**Symptom:** Ownership column missing or empty  
**Check:** Assets table should have 6 columns (not 5)  
**Fix:** Already fixed in code (colspan updated from 5 to 6)

### **Issue 4: Elder Care/Education Not Displaying**
**Symptom:** "No plans yet" message despite sample data  
**Check:** `appState.elderCare` and `appState.educationPlans` arrays  
**Likely cause:** render() functions not called in load()  
**Fix:** Already fixed - all render functions called after load
