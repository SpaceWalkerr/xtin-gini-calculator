# Sample Data Integration - Comprehensive Family Planning Features

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem Identified**
The "Load Sample Data" button was not populating family planning features. It only loaded basic assets, liabilities, and goals without:
- Family members beyond the primary user
- Ownership tracking for assets/liabilities
- Member assignments for goals
- Elder care plans
- Children's education timelines
- Tax optimization settings
- Dual-income household configuration

### **Solution Implemented**
Completely revamped the sample data loader to include **comprehensive, realistic family financial planning data** that demonstrates ALL features of the application.
