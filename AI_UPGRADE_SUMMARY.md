## Advanced Features Implemented

### 🔍 Automatic Risk Detection

**Debt Warning Trigger:**
```javascript
if (debtToAssetRatio > 50%) {
  Flag: "🚨 HIGH RISK - Your debt is 65% of assets"
}
if (debtToAssetRatio > 30%) {
  Flag: "⚠️ MODERATE RISK - Consider debt payoff strategy"
}
```

**Emergency Fund Alert:**
```javascript
if (!hasEmergencyFund) {
  Proactive: "No emergency fund detected. This should be priority #1."
}
```

**Unrealistic Goal Detection:**
```javascript
if (goal.requiredReturn > 18%) {
  Warning: "This goal needs 22% returns - extremely difficult. Let's adjust."
}
```

**Retirement Planning Check:**
```javascript
if (!hasRetirementGoal && userAge > 25) {
  Nudge: "You don't have a retirement plan. Every year of delay costs ₹50L in compounding."
}
```

---

### 🎉 Achievement Celebration

**Goal Completion:**
```javascript
if (goal.progress >= 100%) {
  Celebrate: "🎉 Amazing! You achieved your Emergency Fund goal! ₹6L secured!"
}
```

**Milestone Progress:**
- 25% → "Great start! Keep building momentum!"
- 50% → "Halfway there! You're crushing it!"
- 75% → "Almost there! Final push!"
