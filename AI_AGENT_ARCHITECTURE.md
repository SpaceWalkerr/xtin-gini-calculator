## Proactive Intelligence Features

### üö® Automatic Risk Detection

**Debt Warning:**
- Triggers when debt-to-asset ratio > 50%
- "Your debt is 65% of your assets - this is high risk territory. Let's create a payoff plan."

**Emergency Fund Alert:**
- Detects missing emergency fund
- "I notice you don't have an emergency fund. This should be your #1 priority."

**Unrealistic Goals:**
- Flags goals requiring >18% returns
- "This goal needs 22% annual returns - that's extremely difficult. Let's adjust."

**Retirement Urgency:**
- Identifies users without retirement planning
- "You're 35 with no retirement plan. Every year you delay costs you ‚Çπ50L in compounding."

---

### üéâ Achievement Celebration

**Goal Completion:**
- Detects when goals reach 100%
- "Amazing! You just hit your Emergency Fund goal! That's ‚Çπ6L of financial security. What's next?"

**Milestone Progress:**
- Celebrates 25%, 50%, 75% milestones
- "You're halfway to your house down payment! Keep crushing it!"

---

## Advanced Data Analysis

### Real-Time Calculations

**Currently Implemented:**
- Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities
- Debt-to-Asset Ratio = (Liabilities / Assets) √ó 100
- Savings Rate = (Net Worth / Assets) √ó 100
- Portfolio Weighted Return
- Goal Progress Tracking
- Required Return Analysis

**In Context (Gini knows how to calculate):**
- Future Value: FV = PV √ó (1 + r)^n
- SIP Required: PMT = (FV - PV√ó(1+r)^n) √ó r / ((1+r)^n - 1)
- EMI: EMI = P √ó r √ó (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)
- Monte Carlo Simulations (10,000 runs)

## Response Structure

Every response follows this optimized format:

```
1. Empathetic Acknowledgment
   "Great question! Let me analyze your situation..."

2. Key Data Insight
